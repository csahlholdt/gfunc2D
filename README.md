# 2D G functions

gfunc2d is a package for calculating the joint age-metallicity probability density function (2D G function) of one or more stars. The code requires a grid of stellar models saved in the HDF5 format. An example of such a grid can be found here: https://lu.box.com/s/z3jyz9metpeg42o8dqx5dqd6phvlx190 (Last checked on October 21 2021).
